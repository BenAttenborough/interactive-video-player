## Title

Interactive Video player

## Synopsis

RWD project for the Treehouse Frontend Web Developer TechDegree

From Treehouse: "In this project, you'll build an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. 
"Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, you'll build an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. 
"The transcript should be placed below the video, and should highlight as the video progresses. 
"When a user clicks any part of the transcript it should take them to the appropriate place in the video."
